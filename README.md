# Tic-Tac-Toe
 Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++ playable through the console.
 
 # Goal of this project
 I wanted to learn C++ so I thought that making a small game like this would be a nice start. It may not be perfect, but it's playable so I'm happy with it.
 I will also try to implement a simple AI algorithm (Minimax) to have it control the second player.
